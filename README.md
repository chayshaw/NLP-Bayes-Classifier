# NLP - Bayes-Classifier 

This is an example of using a Bayes Classifier with NLTK & TextBlob to classify a set of text.
Both the Text and the Corpus are stored as files rather than being entered by a user.
The output is also a csv file which lists the raw test, the classification and the accuracy score for that classification. 

## Demo

I put this together as part of a learning exercise to understand how NLTK & Python work. This is an example of a Bayes classifier to catorgize text based on a known corpus.
It also provides a simple example of adding n-grams as well to assist with the classification. 

## Installation

You will need the following
- Python 3.4
- NLTK 3.0
- TextBlob
Use the standard pip3 commands to install the Python packages. 
You will need to setup NTLK following the setup guide from nltk.org
