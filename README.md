# NLP-Bayes-Classifier

This is an example of using a Bayes Classifier with NLTK & TextBlob to classify a set of text.
Both the Test and the Corpus are stored as files rather than being enter. 


## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

I put this together as part of a learning exercise to understand how NLTK & Python work. This is an example of a Bayes classifier to catorgize text based on a known corpus.

## Installation

You will need the following
- Python 3.4
- NLTK 3.0
- TextBlob
Use the standard pip3 commands to install the Python packages.
